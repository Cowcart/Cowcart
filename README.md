Greetings. This is where I would put something Important, like pronouns or stuff, but you can just call me by Cowcart.
I grew up in Mitchigan, in a small town. That one town the local drunky crashed into the cafe? 
I plan to make goofy little games and  whatnot. I plan to leave my assets and projects here. Average online goober.
I hope to make funny but insteresting games for people around the contury to enjoy. Maybe even the UK or Canida, but I'll see how it goes.
I am  currently a little young, if you could'nt tell by my poor grammer skills... Sorry.
I hope you stay a liitle while. Maybe take a look around my profile, if I even have anything there.
I don't know who you are or why you're here, but even if you're just reading by, I'm happy to see you here.
